                <article style="text-align:justify ;">The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized and marketed as iPhone
                    12 mini) are a range of smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the
                    fourteenth-generation, "affordable flagship" iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11. They were unveiled
                    at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on October 13, 2020,
                    alongside the "premium flagship" iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max and HomePod Mini. Pre-orders
                    for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone became available in most countries on
                    October 23, 2020 alongside the iPhone 12 Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air. Pre-orders for the
                    iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone became available on November 13, 2020
                    alongside the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
                    <br>
                    The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It features a chassis with
                    flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018 and the
                    4th-generation iPad Air, which also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone
                    models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.The borders around the display are thinner by
                    35% than any previous model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed
                    as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened
                    glass.
